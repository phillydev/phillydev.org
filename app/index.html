<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>
  We value the participation of each member of the community and want everyone
  to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are
  expected to show respect and courtesy to other members.
</p>

<p>
  To make clear what is expected, all members, organizers and volunteers
  associated with the PhillyDev community are required to conform to the
  following Code of Conduct.
</p>

<h3>The Short Version</h3>

<p>
  The PhillyDev community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
  for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
  appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
  participants in any form.
</p>

<p>
  All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
  people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
  appropriate.
</p>

<p>
  Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Behave
  professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
  jokes are not appropriate for the PhillyDev community.
</p>

<p>
  Members violating these rules may be asked to leave the group at the sole
  discretion of the organizers.
</p>

<p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly group for all.</p>

<h3>The Longer Version</h3>

<p>
  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
  sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
  harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
  events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
</p>

<p>
  Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
  immediately.
</p>

<p>
  Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
  other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive
  swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for the PhillyDev community.
</p>

<p>
  If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the
  organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
  offender or expulsion from the group.
</p>

<h3>Contact Information</h3>
