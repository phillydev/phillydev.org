    <h2 id="what">What is PhillyDev</h2>

    <p>
      What is PhillyDev?  PhillyDev is a place for developers who live and work in
      and around Philly to share, converse, organize and get to know each
      other.
    </p>

    <p>
      Powered by Slack, PhillyDev is a group of chat rooms and is a great way to
      connect on tech in Philly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="conduct">Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>
      We value the participation of each member of the community and want everyone
      to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all members are
      expected to show respect and courtesy to other members.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make clear what is expected, all members, organizers and volunteers
      associated with the PhillyDev community are required to conform to the
      following Code of Conduct.
    </p>

    <h3>The Short Version</h3>

    <p>
      The PhillyDev community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
      for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical
      appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
      participants in any form.
    </p>

    <p>
      All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
      people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
      appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other members. Behave
      professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
      jokes are not appropriate for the PhillyDev community.
    </p>

    <p>
      Members violating these rules may be asked to leave the group at the sole
      discretion of the organizers.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly group for all.</p>

    <h3>The Longer Version</h3>

    <p>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual
      orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion,
      sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following,
      harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
      events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
      immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and
      other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive
      swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for the PhillyDev community.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the
      organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
      offender or expulsion from the group.
    </p>
